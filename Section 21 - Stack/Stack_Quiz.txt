Question 1: Given the following sequence of stack operations, what is the top item on the stack when the sequence is complete?

m = Stack()
m.push('x')
m.push('y')
m.pop()
m.push('z')
m.peek()

Answer: z

Question 2:
Given the following sequence of stack operations, what is the top item on the stack when the sequence is complete?

m = Stack()
m.push('x')
m.push('y')
m.push('z')
while not m.isEmpty():
   m.pop()
   m.pop()

Answer: Depends on the pop method implementation - second m.pop() is called but the stack is empty. At this point, behavior depends on how pop() is implemented.
